Okay, this is a comprehensive set of findings. Let's break them down and provide actionable recommendations to enhance your AWS infrastructure security.

## AWS Security Scan Analysis and Recommendations

---

### 1. Executive Summary

The security scan results from TFSec and Checkov reveal several critical and high-severity vulnerabilities, primarily concentrated around Amazon S3 bucket configurations, AWS WAFv2, and CloudFront distributions. Key deficiencies include missing server-side encryption (specifically with Customer Managed Keys - CMK), absent S3 access logging and versioning for one bucket, lack of crucial WAF rules (e.g., for Log4j), and missing advanced CloudFront security features like geo-restrictions and response headers policies.

The overall severity assessment of the current infrastructure, based on these findings, is **HIGH**. While some foundational security measures like S3 public access blocks and basic CloudFront HTTPS settings are in place, the lack of comprehensive encryption, logging, and threat mitigation capabilities exposes the S3 data and web application to significant risks, including data breaches, data loss, unauthorized access, and common web exploits. Addressing these issues promptly is crucial for improving the security posture.

### 2. Critical Issues

Based on the scan, the most critical issues revolve around S3 bucket encryption and WAF protection against known vulnerabilities.

#### 2.1. Unencrypted S3 Buckets & Lack of Customer Managed Key (CMK) Usage
*   **TFSec IDs**: `aws-s3-enable-bucket-encryption`, `aws-s3-encryption-customer-key`
*   **Checkov ID**: `CKV_AWS_145`
*   **Affected Resources**: `aws_s3_bucket.website_assets` (terraform/main.tf:54-62), `aws_s3_bucket.cloudfront_logs` (terraform/main.tf:79-86)
*   **Severity**: HIGH (TFSec), FAILED (Checkov)

*   **Explanation**:
    The S3 buckets `website_assets` and `cloudfront_logs` are not configured with server-side encryption using AWS Key Management Service (KMS) Customer Managed Keys (CMKs). While S3 now encrypts new objects by default with SSE-S3 (AES256), explicitly defining encryption, especially with CMKs, provides an auditable trail, centralized key management, and granular control over data encryption. TFSec flags the general lack of encryption and specifically the absence of CMK usage. Checkov `CKV_AWS_145` also flags that KMS default encryption isn't configured.
    *Note: Checkov `CKV_AWS_19` ("Ensure all data stored in the S3 bucket is securely encrypted at rest") PASSED. This might indicate that default SSE-S3 encryption is active at an account level or that Checkov's check is less stringent than TFSec's specific CMK requirement or explicit bucket-level encryption configuration.* We will proceed with the recommendation for explicit SSE-KMS with CMK for best practice.

*   **Problematic Code (Conceptual - showing absence of configuration)**:
    ```terraform
    # terraform/main.tf:54-62 (website_assets)
    resource "aws_s3_bucket" "website_assets" {
      bucket = "${var.project_name}-assets-${random_id.bucket_suffix.hex}"
      tags   = var.common_tags

      versioning {
        enabled = true
      }
      # MISSING: server_side_encryption_configuration
    }

    # terraform/main.tf:79-86 (cloudfront_logs)
    resource "aws_s3_bucket" "cloudfront_logs" {
      bucket = "${var.project_name}-cf-logs-${random_id.bucket_suffix.hex}"
      tags   = var.common_tags

      lifecycle {
        prevent_destroy = false
      }
      # MISSING: server_side_encryption_configuration
    }
    ```

*   **Corrected Code**:
    First, define a KMS key:
    ```terraform
    resource "aws_kms_key" "s3_bucket_key" {
      description             = "KMS key for S3 bucket encryption"
      enable_key_rotation = true
      tags                    = var.common_tags
    }
    ```
    Then, apply it to the buckets:
    ```terraform
    # For aws_s3_bucket.website_assets
    resource "aws_s3_bucket_server_side_encryption_configuration" "website_assets_encryption" {
      bucket = aws_s3_bucket.website_assets.id

      rule {
        apply_server_side_encryption_by_default {
          sse_algorithm     = "aws:kms"
          kms_master_key_id = aws_kms_key.s3_bucket_key.arn
        }
        bucket_key_enabled = true # Recommended for performance and cost
      }
    }

    # For aws_s3_bucket.cloudfront_logs
    resource "aws_s3_bucket_server_side_encryption_configuration" "cloudfront_logs_encryption" {
      bucket = aws_s3_bucket.cloudfront_logs.id

      rule {
        apply_server_side_encryption_by_default {
          sse_algorithm     = "aws:kms"
          kms_master_key_id = aws_kms_key.s3_bucket_key.arn # Or a separate key for logs
        }
        bucket_key_enabled = true
      }
    }
    ```

*   **Potential Impact**:
    If data at rest is not encrypted (or not encrypted with CMKs), it increases the risk of data exposure in the event of unauthorized access to the underlying storage. Lack of CMK usage reduces control over key rotation and auditing capabilities related to data access.

*   **Step-by-step Remediation**:
    1.  Define an `aws_kms_key` resource in your Terraform configuration. Consider if one key is sufficient or if separate keys for different data classifications (e.g., assets vs. logs) are needed.
    2.  Enable key rotation for the KMS key (`enable_key_rotation = true`).
    3.  For each S3 bucket (`website_assets` and `cloudfront_logs`), add an `aws_s3_bucket_server_side_encryption_configuration` resource.
    4.  Configure the rule to use `aws:kms` for `sse_algorithm` and provide the ARN of the created KMS key.
    5.  Enable `bucket_key_enabled = true` for cost savings and performance benefits.
    6.  Run `terraform plan` and `terraform apply`.

#### 2.2. WAF Missing Log4j Vulnerability Protection
*   **Checkov IDs**: `CKV_AWS_192`, `CKV2_AWS_47`
*   **Affected Resource**: `aws_wafv2_web_acl.default` (terraform/main.tf:172-228), indirectly `aws_cloudfront_distribution.s3_distribution`
*   **Severity**: FAILED (CRITICAL implied due to CVE severity)

*   **Explanation**:
    The AWS WAFv2 Web ACL (`aws_wafv2_web_acl.default`) is not configured with rules to specifically mitigate the Log4j vulnerability (CVE-2021-44228, and related). `CKV_AWS_192` points to the WAF configuration itself, while `CKV2_AWS_47` flags that the CloudFront distribution's attached WAF ACL is missing the AWS Managed Rule (AMR) for Log4j.

*   **Problematic Code (Conceptual - showing absence of specific rule group)**:
    ```terraform
    # terraform/main.tf:172-228
    resource "aws_wafv2_web_acl" "default" {
      name        = "${var.project_name}-waf-acl"
      scope       = "CLOUDFRONT"
      description = "WAF ACL for ${var.project_name}"
      # ... other configurations ...

      # MISSING: Rule for Log4j, ideally AWSManagedRulesKnownBadInputsRuleSet
      # or AWSManagedRulesLog4JRCEAttackRuleSet (if available and preferred)

      default_action {
        allow {}
      }

      visibility_config {
        cloudwatch_metrics_enabled = true
        metric_name                = "${var.project_name}-waf"
        sampled_requests_enabled   = true
      }
      # ... other rules ...
    }
    ```

*   **Corrected Code**:
    Add the AWS Managed Rule group `AWSManagedRulesKnownBadInputsRuleSet`, which includes protections for Log4j.
    ```terraform
    resource "aws_wafv2_web_acl" "default" {
      name        = "${var.project_name}-waf-acl"
      scope       = "CLOUDFRONT"
      description = "WAF ACL for ${var.project_name}"

      default_action {
        allow {}
      }

      # Rule for Log4j and other known bad inputs
      rule {
        name     = "AWSManagedRulesKnownBadInputsRuleSet"
        priority = 1 # Adjust priority as needed
        override_action {
          none {} # Use the actions defined in the rule group
        }
        statement {
          managed_rule_group_statement {
            vendor_name = "AWS"
            name        = "AWSManagedRulesKnownBadInputsRuleSet"
            # You can exclude specific rules within the group if necessary,
            # but for Log4j, ensure the relevant rules are active.
            # Example of excluding a rule (NOT recommended for Log4j rule itself):
            # excluded_rule {
            #   name = "SizeRestrictions_QUERYSTRING"
            # }
          }
        }
        visibility_config {
          cloudwatch_metrics_enabled = true
          metric_name                = "KnownBadInputsRuleSet"
          sampled_requests_enabled   = true
        }
      }

      # Add other existing/new rules, ensuring unique priorities
      # Example: Common attacks rule set
      rule {
        name     = "AWSManagedRulesCommonRuleSet"
        priority = 10 # Ensure priority is unique and logical
        override_action {
          none {}
        }
        statement {
          managed_rule_group_statement {
            vendor_name = "AWS"
            name        = "AWSManagedRulesCommonRuleSet"
          }
        }
        visibility_config {
          cloudwatch_metrics_enabled = true
          metric_name                = "CommonRuleSet"
          sampled_requests_enabled   = true
        }
      }
      # ... other rules from original WAF config ...

      tags = var.common_tags

      visibility_config {
        cloudwatch_metrics_enabled = true
        metric_name                = "${var.project_name}-waf"
        sampled_requests_enabled   = true
      }
    }
    ```

*   **Potential Impact**:
    Failure to protect against Log4j vulnerabilities can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) on backend systems if they are vulnerable, potentially resulting in complete system compromise.

*   **Step-by-step Remediation**:
    1.  Identify the `aws_wafv2_web_acl` resource in your Terraform code (lines 172-228).
    2.  Add a new `rule` block that incorporates the `AWSManagedRulesKnownBadInputsRuleSet`. This rule group is maintained by AWS and includes protections for Log4j.
    3.  Set an appropriate `priority` for this rule (lower numbers are evaluated first).
    4.  Ensure `override_action { none {} }` is set to use the default actions within the managed rule group (which is typically to block).
    5.  Review other AWS Managed Rule groups like `AWSManagedRulesCommonRuleSet` and `AWSManagedRulesAmazonIpReputationList` and add them with appropriate priorities for broader protection.
    6.  Run `terraform plan` and `terraform apply`.
    7.  Monitor WAF logs and CloudWatch metrics for legitimate traffic being blocked (false positives) and adjust rule actions (e.g., to `count`) or exclude specific sub-rules if necessary.

### 3. High and Medium Priority Issues

#### S3 Bucket Issues

1.  **S3 Bucket Logging Not Enabled**
    *   **TFSec IDs**: `aws-s3-enable-bucket-logging` (MEDIUM)
    *   **Checkov ID**: `CKV_AWS_18` (FAILED)
    *   **Affected Resources**: `aws_s3_bucket.website_assets` (terraform/main.tf:54-62), `aws_s3_bucket.cloudfront_logs` (terraform/main.tf:79-86)
    *   **Explanation**: S3 server access logging provides detailed records for the requests that are made to a bucket. This is crucial for security auditing, monitoring access patterns, and incident response.
    *   **Recommendation**: Enable server access logging for both buckets. Create a dedicated S3 bucket for storing these logs (it should not be the same bucket that is being logged).
        ```terraform
        resource "aws_s3_bucket" "s3_access_logs_target" {
          bucket = "${var.project_name}-s3-access-logs-${random_id.bucket_suffix.hex}"
          tags   = var.common_tags
          # Apply lifecycle, encryption, etc. to this log bucket as well
        }

        resource "aws_s3_bucket_logging" "website_assets_logging" {
          bucket = aws_s3_bucket.website_assets.id

          target_bucket = aws_s3_bucket.s3_access_logs_target.id
          target_prefix = "website_assets/"
        }

        resource "aws_s3_bucket_logging" "cloudfront_logs_logging" {
          bucket = aws_s3_bucket.cloudfront_logs.id

          target_bucket = aws_s3_bucket.s3_access_logs_target.id
          target_prefix = "cloudfront_logs/"
        }
        ```
        Ensure the `aws_s3_bucket.s3_access_logs_target` has a policy allowing the S3 log delivery service to write to it.

2.  **S3 Bucket Versioning Not Enabled for `cloudfront_logs`**
    *   **TFSec ID**: `aws-s3-enable-versioning` (MEDIUM) - Note: Scan implies for cloudfront_logs (79-86).
    *   **Checkov ID**: `CKV_AWS_21` (FAILED for `aws_s3_bucket.cloudfront_logs`)
    *   **Affected Resource**: `aws_s3_bucket.cloudfront_logs` (terraform/main.tf:79-86)
    *   **Explanation**: Versioning keeps multiple variants of an object in the same bucket. This helps protect against accidental overwrites or deletions and can assist in data recovery.
        *Note: `aws_s3_bucket.website_assets` has versioning enabled according to its definition and passed Checkov `CKV_AWS_21`.*
    *   **Recommendation**: Enable versioning for the `aws_s3_bucket.cloudfront_logs` bucket.
        ```terraform
        resource "aws_s3_bucket_versioning" "cloudfront_logs_versioning" {
          bucket = aws_s3_bucket.cloudfront_logs.id
          versioning_configuration {
            status = "Enabled"
          }
        }
        ```
        This can also be done directly in the `aws_s3_bucket` resource:
        ```terraform
        resource "aws_s3_bucket" "cloudfront_logs" {
          bucket = "${var.project_name}-cf-logs-${random_id.bucket_suffix.hex}"
          tags   = var.common_tags

          versioning { # Add this block
            enabled = true
          }

          lifecycle {
            prevent_destroy = false
          }
        }
        ```

3.  **S3 Bucket Event Notifications Not Enabled**
    *   **Checkov ID**: `CKV2_AWS_62` (FAILED)
    *   **Affected Resources**: `aws_s3_bucket.website_assets`, `aws_s3_bucket.cloudfront_logs`
    *   **Explanation**: S3 event notifications can trigger actions (e.g., Lambda functions, SNS topics, SQS queues) in response to events like object creation or deletion. This can be used for automated processing, alerting on suspicious activity, or integrating with other services.
    *   **Recommendation**: Assess if event notifications are required for your use case. If so, configure `aws_s3_bucket_notification`. For example, to send a notification to an SNS topic for all object creation events:
        ```terraform
        resource "aws_sns_topic" "s3_events" {
          name = "${var.project_name}-s3-events"
        }

        resource "aws_s3_bucket_notification" "website_assets_notification" {
          bucket = aws_s3_bucket.website_assets.id

          topic {
            topic_arn     = aws_sns_topic.s3_events.arn
            events        = ["s3:ObjectCreated:*"]
            # filter_prefix = "images/" # Optional
          }
        }
        # Repeat for cloudfront_logs if needed
        ```
        This is highly use-case dependent. It's a "MEDIUM" concern if no specific monitoring or automated action based on S3 events is required.

4.  **S3 Bucket Cross-Region Replication (CRR) Not Enabled**
    *   **Checkov ID**: `CKV_AWS_144` (FAILED)
    *   **Affected Resources**: `aws_s3_bucket.website_assets`, `aws_s3_bucket.cloudfront_logs`
    *   **Explanation**: CRR automatically replicates data to a bucket in a different AWS region. This is crucial for disaster recovery, data sovereignty, and latency reduction for users in different geographical locations.
    *   **Recommendation**: Evaluate if CRR is necessary based on your RTO/RPO and business continuity requirements. If yes, create a destination bucket in another region and configure `aws_s3_bucket_replication_configuration`. This requires versioning to be enabled on both source and destination buckets.
        ```terraform
        # --- In a different region provider block ---
        # provider "aws" {
        #   alias  = "replica_region"
        #   region = "us-west-1" # Example replica region
        # }
        # resource "aws_s3_bucket" "website_assets_replica" {
        #   provider = aws.replica_region
        #   bucket   = "${var.project_name}-assets-replica-${random_id.bucket_suffix.hex}"
        #   # Ensure versioning and encryption are enabled here too
        # }
        # --- Back in the primary region ---
        # resource "aws_iam_role" "replication_role" { ... }
        # resource "aws_iam_policy" "replication_policy" { ... }
        # resource "aws_s3_bucket_replication_configuration" "website_assets_replication" {
        #   depends_on = [aws_s3_bucket_versioning.website_assets_versioning] # if versioning is a separate resource
        #   role       = aws_iam_role.replication_role.arn
        #   bucket     = aws_s3_bucket.website_assets.id
        #   rule {
        #     id       = "replicateToReplicaRegion"
        #     status   = "Enabled"
        #     priority = 1
        #     destination {
        #       bucket        = aws_s3_bucket.website_assets_replica.arn # ARN of replica bucket
        #       storage_class = "STANDARD"
        #     }
        #     # Optional: filter, source_selection_criteria for SSE-KMS encrypted objects
        #   }
        # }
        ```
        This is a significant architectural decision and might be MEDIUM or LOW priority depending on business needs.

5.  **S3 Bucket Lifecycle Configuration Missing**
    *   **Checkov ID**: `CKV2_AWS_61` (FAILED)
    *   **Affected Resources**: `aws_s3_bucket.website_assets`, `aws_s3_bucket.cloudfront_logs`
    *   **Explanation**: Lifecycle configurations manage your objects so that they are stored cost-effectively throughout their lifecycle. This can involve transitioning objects to cheaper storage classes (e.g., S3 Glacier) or deleting old objects/versions.
    *   **Recommendation**: Define `aws_s3_bucket_lifecycle_configuration` for both buckets, especially for `cloudfront_logs` to manage log retention and costs.
        ```terraform
        resource "aws_s3_bucket_lifecycle_configuration" "cloudfront_logs_lifecycle" {
          bucket = aws_s3_bucket.cloudfront_logs.id

          rule {
            id     = "logArchive"
            status = "Enabled"

            transition {
              days          = 30
              storage_class = "STANDARD_IA" # Infrequent Access
            }

            transition {
              days          = 90
              storage_class = "GLACIER_IR" # Glacier Instant Retrieval
            }

            expiration {
              days = 365 # Delete logs older than 1 year
            }

            # For versioned buckets, manage noncurrent versions
            noncurrent_version_transition {
              noncurrent_days = 30
              storage_class   = "STANDARD_IA"
            }
            noncurrent_version_expiration {
              noncurrent_days = 90
            }
          }
        }
        # Apply a similar, appropriate policy for website_assets
        ```

#### WAFv2 Issues

1.  **WAFv2 Logging Not Configured**
    *   **Checkov ID**: `CKV2_AWS_31` (FAILED)
    *   **Affected Resource**: `aws_wafv2_web_acl.default` (terraform/main.tf:172-228)
    *   **Explanation**: WAFv2 logs provide detailed information about traffic that AWS WAF inspects. These logs are essential for monitoring, troubleshooting, and security analysis.
    *   **Recommendation**: Configure logging for your WAFv2 Web ACL. This typically involves sending logs to an S3 bucket via Kinesis Data Firehose or directly to CloudWatch Logs.
        ```terraform
        # Example: Logging to a Kinesis Firehose delivery stream (which then writes to S3)
        resource "aws_s3_bucket" "waf_logs_target" {
          bucket = "${var.project_name}-waf-acl-logs-${random_id.bucket_suffix.hex}"
          # ... other configurations like lifecycle, encryption ...
        }

        resource "aws_iam_role" "firehose_role" {
          name = "${var.project_name}-firehose-role"
          assume_role_policy = jsonencode({
            Version = "2012-10-17",
            Statement = [{
              Action = "sts:AssumeRole",
              Effect = "Allow",
              Principal = { Service = "firehose.amazonaws.com" }
            }]
          })
        }
        # Add policies to firehose_role to allow writing to S3 and any KMS key used

        resource "aws_kinesis_firehose_delivery_stream" "waf_firehose_stream" {
          name        = "${var.project_name}-waf-logs-stream"
          destination = "s3" # or "extended_s3" for more options

          s3_configuration {
            role_arn        = aws_iam_role.firehose_role.arn
            bucket_arn      = aws_s3_bucket.waf_logs_target.arn
            prefix          = "waf_logs/"
            # compression_format = "GZIP"
          }
          tags = var.common_tags
        }

#### CloudFront Distribution Issues

1.  **CloudFront Origin Failover Not Configured**
    *   **Checkov ID**: `CKV_AWS_310` (FAILED)
    *   **Affected Resource**: `aws_cloudfront_distribution.s3_distribution` (terraform/main.tf:232-300)
    *   **Explanation**: Origin failover improves availability by configuring CloudFront to automatically switch to a secondary origin if the primary origin is unavailable.
    *   **Recommendation**: If high availability is critical, configure an origin group with a primary and secondary origin (e.g., another S3 bucket, perhaps in a different region if CRR is set up).
        ```terraform
        resource "aws_cloudfront_distribution" "s3_distribution" {
          # ... existing config ...
          origin_group {
            origin_id = "S3FailoverGroup"
            failover_criteria {
              status_codes = [500, 502, 503, 504] # Customize as needed
            }
            member {
              origin_id = "PrimaryS3Origin" # Your existing S3 origin_id
            }
            member {
              origin_id = "SecondaryS3Origin" # A new origin_id for your backup S3
            }
          }

          origin {
            domain_name = aws_s3_bucket.website_assets.bucket_regional_domain_name
            origin_id   = "PrimaryS3Origin" # Matches member
            # ... existing origin config ...
          }

          origin {
            domain_name = "backup-s3-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com" # Example backup bucket
            origin_id   = "SecondaryS3Origin" # Matches member
            # ... configure OAI for this backup origin too ...
          }

          default_cache_behavior {
            target_origin_id = "S3FailoverGroup" # Point to the origin group
            # ... existing cache behavior ...
          }
          # ... rest of distribution ...
        }
        ```

2.  **CloudFront Geo Restriction Not Enabled**
    *   **Checkov ID**: `CKV_AWS_374` (FAILED)
    *   **Affected Resource**: `aws_cloudfront_distribution.s3_distribution`
    *   **Explanation**: Geo-restriction (geoblocking) allows you to prevent users in specific geographic locations from accessing content. This can be used for licensing restrictions or to block traffic from regions known for malicious activity.
    *   **Recommendation**: If applicable, configure geo-restrictions.
        ```terraform
        resource "aws_cloudfront_distribution" "s3_distribution" {
          # ... existing config ...
          restrictions {
            geo_restriction {
              restriction_type = "whitelist" # or "blacklist"
              locations        = ["US", "CA", "GB"] # ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country codes
            }
          }
          # ... rest of distribution ...
        }
        ```

3.  **CloudFront Response Headers Policy Not Attached**
    *   **Checkov ID**: `CKV2_AWS_32` (FAILED)
    *   **Affected Resource**: `aws_cloudfront_distribution.s3_distribution`
    *   **Explanation**: Response headers policies allow CloudFront to add HTTP headers (e.g., HSTS, X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, CSP) to responses served to viewers, enhancing security.
    *   **Recommendation**: Create and attach an `aws_cloudfront_response_headers_policy`.
        ```terraform
        resource "aws_cloudfront_response_headers_policy" "security_headers_policy" {
          name    = "${var.project_name}-security-headers"
          comment = "Adds common security headers"
          security_headers_config {
            strict_transport_security {
              override                   = true
              access_control_max_age_sec = 31536000 # 1 year
              include_subdomains         = true
              preload                    = true
            }
            content_type_options {
              override = true
            }
            xss_protection {
              override   = true
              protection = true
              mode_block = true
            }
            frame_options {
              override     = true
              frame_option = "SAMEORIGIN" # Or DENY
            }
            referrer_policy {
              override        = true
              referrer_policy = "strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
            }
            # content_security_policy { # CSP is powerful but needs careful configuration
            #   override = true
            #   content_security_policy = "default-src 'self';"
            # }
          }
        }

        resource "aws_cloudfront_distribution" "s3_distribution" {
          # ... existing config ...
          default_cache_behavior {
            # ... existing cache behavior ...
            response_headers_policy_id = aws_cloudfront_response_headers_policy.security_headers_policy.id
          }
          # Apply to other cache behaviors if they exist
        }
        ```

### 4. General Security Recommendations

1.  **IAM Roles and Permissions**:
    *   **Least Privilege**: Continuously review IAM roles and policies attached to users, groups, and services. Grant only the permissions necessary to perform their intended functions.
    *   **KMS Key Policy**: Ensure the KMS key policy (`aws_kms_key.s3_bucket_key`) grants necessary `kms:Decrypt`, `kms:Encrypt`, `kms:ReEncrypt*`, `kms:GenerateDataKey*`, `kms:DescribeKey` permissions to entities that need to access encrypted S3 data. Also, allow administrative access to trusted IAM principals for key management. The S3 service itself will need permissions if using Bucket Keys or replication with SSE-KMS.
    *   **Service Roles**: For services like Kinesis Firehose or S3 Replication, ensure their IAM roles have precisely scoped permissions to write to target S3 buckets and use necessary KMS keys.

2.  **Encryption**:
    *   **Enforce In-Transit Encryption**: While CloudFront is configured for HTTPS, ensure all backend communications (if any beyond S3) also use TLS.
    *   **KMS Key Rotation**: Already recommended (`enable_key_rotation = true`), this is crucial for CMKs.

3.  **Network Security**:
    *   **VPC Endpoints for S3**: If EC2 instances or other VPC resources access these S3 buckets, consider using VPC Gateway Endpoints for S3. This keeps traffic within the AWS network and allows you to control access via endpoint policies.

4.  **Architectural Improvements**:
    *   **Defense in Depth**: Continue layering security controls (WAF, S3 ACLs/Policies, CloudFront settings, IAM).
    *   **Immutable Infrastructure**: Where possible, treat infrastructure components as immutable. Re-deploy with new configurations rather than modifying in place.
    *   **Secure Defaults**: Establish secure Terraform modules for common resources (like S3 buckets, WAF ACLs) that include these security configurations by default.

5.  **Parsing Errors**:
    The scan reported `Error parsing file ./tsconfig.app.json` and `Error parsing file ./tsconfig.node.json`. These are TypeScript configuration files, not Terraform. Exclude non-Terraform files from your Checkov scan scope to prevent these errors and speed up scans. For example: `checkov -d . --exclude-path terraform/.terraform,terraform/node_modules,tsconfig.app.json,tsconfig.node.json`

### 5. Implementation Plan

1.  **Immediate (Critical - Next 1-3 Days)**:
    *   [ ] **S3 Encryption**: Implement SSE-KMS with CMKs for `website_assets` and `cloudfront_logs` buckets. (Addresses TFSec HIGH, Checkov `CKV_AWS_145`)
    *   [ ] **WAF Log4j Protection**: Add `AWSManagedRulesKnownBadInputsRuleSet` (or similar targeted Log4j rule) to `aws_wafv2_web_acl.default`. (Addresses Checkov `CKV_AWS_192`, `CKV2_AWS_47`)

2.  **High Priority (Next 1 Week)**:
    *   [ ] **S3 Access Logging**: Enable server access logging for both S3 buckets, directing logs to a separate, secure log bucket. (Addresses TFSec MEDIUM `aws-s3-enable-bucket-logging`, Checkov `CKV_AWS_18`)
    *   [ ] **S3 Versioning**: Enable versioning for `aws_s3_bucket.cloudfront_logs`. (Addresses TFSec MEDIUM `aws-s3-enable-versioning`, Checkov `CKV_AWS_21`)
    *   [ ] **WAF Logging**: Configure logging for `aws_wafv2_web_acl.default`. (Addresses Checkov `CKV2_AWS_31`)
    *   [ ] **CloudFront Response Headers**: Implement a `aws_cloudfront_response_headers_policy` for security headers. (Addresses Checkov `CKV2_AWS_32`)

3.  **Medium Priority (Next 2-4 Weeks)**:
    *   [ ] **S3 Lifecycle Policies**: Configure lifecycle policies for both S3 buckets, especially `cloudfront_logs`. (Addresses Checkov `CKV2_AWS_61`)
    *   [ ] **CloudFront Geo-Restrictions**: Implement geo-restrictions if applicable to business requirements. (Addresses Checkov `CKV_AWS_374`)
    *   [ ] **S3 Event Notifications**: Evaluate and implement S3 event notifications if needed for monitoring or automation. (Addresses Checkov `CKV2_AWS_62`)
    *   [ ] **CloudFront Origin Failover**: Evaluate and implement origin failover for CloudFront if high availability is a top requirement. (Addresses Checkov `CKV_AWS_310`)
    *   [ ] **S3 Cross-Region Replication**: Evaluate and implement CRR based on DR and business continuity needs. (Addresses Checkov `CKV_AWS_144`)

4.  **Suggested Security Monitoring Improvements**:
    *   **AWS Security Hub**: Aggregate findings from GuardDuty, Config, Inspector, and integrated third-party tools. It can also consume Checkov/TFSec results if formatted correctly (e.g., ASFF).
    *   **AWS GuardDuty**: Enable GuardDuty for threat detection across your AWS accounts.
    *   **AWS Config**: Implement AWS Config rules to continuously monitor resource configurations for compliance with security best practices (many Checkov rules have corresponding Config rules).
    *   **CloudTrail**: Ensure CloudTrail is enabled in all regions, logging to a secure, central S3 bucket with integrity validation and KMS encryption.
    *   **Alerting**: Set up CloudWatch Alarms or EventBridge rules based on critical WAF logs, S3 access patterns (e.g., via Athena queries on logs), or Security Hub findings.

5.  **Recommendations for Ongoing Security Assessments**:
    *   **CI/CD Integration**: Integrate TFSec and Checkov scans into your CI/CD pipeline to catch issues before deployment. Fail builds on high/critical severity findings.
    *   **Regular Scans**: Schedule regular scans of your deployed infrastructure (e.g., weekly) even if IaC is the source of truth, to catch drifts or out-of-band changes.
    *   **Penetration Testing**: Conduct periodic penetration tests against your application and infrastructure.
    *   **Threat Modeling**: Periodically review your architecture and perform threat modeling exercises to identify potential attack vectors.
    *   **Review IAM Permissions**: Regularly audit IAM roles and policies for excessive permissions. Use IAM Access Analyzer to identify unused permissions and public/cross-account access.

By systematically addressing these findings and implementing ongoing security practices, you can significantly improve the security posture of your AWS infrastructure. Remember to test changes in a non-production environment before applying them to production.
