# Infrastructure Deployment Recommendations

## Executive Summary

This infrastructure plan was generated by Inframate based on analyzing your application's requirements and codebase structure.

### Recommended AWS Services:

- Lambda
- API Gateway
- CloudWatch
- S3
- CloudFront

## Recommendations

- Use serverless architecture with Lambda and API Gateway for Node.js applications
- Host frontend on S3 with CloudFront for global CDN

## Estimated Monthly Costs

Estimated total monthly cost: $46-156/month

Breakdown:
Lambda: $20-60/month (1M requests)
API Gateway: $10-30/month (1M requests)
CloudWatch: $5-20/month (basic monitoring)
S3: $1-6/month (standard storage)
CloudFront: $10-40/month (50GB data transfer)

*Note: These cost estimates are approximate and may vary based on usage patterns, region, and AWS pricing changes.*

## Deployment Instructions

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials
   - Terraform installed (v1.0.0+)

2. **Configuration**:
   - Update variables in `terraform.tfvars` to match your requirements
   - Review the Terraform files to ensure they meet your needs

3. **Deployment**:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   terraform plan
   terraform apply
   ```

4. **Cleanup**:
   ```bash
   terraform destroy
   ```

## Notes

- The Terraform files have been generated in the `terraform/` directory
- The configuration is based on the application requirements specified in `inframate.md`
- You may need to customize the Terraform files for your specific needs
