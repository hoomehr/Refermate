# Infrastructure Deployment Recommendations

## Executive Summary

This infrastructure plan was generated by Inframate based on analyzing your application's requirements and codebase structure.

### Recommended AWS Services:

**

EC2, ALB, S3, CloudFront, Route53, RDS, VPC, CloudWatch, IAM, ACM, Lambda (optional - for serverless tasks), CloudTrail, Config

**

## Detailed Recommendations

**
*   **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC):**  Create a VPC with public and private subnets.  The application servers should reside in private subnets, while the ALB resides in public subnets.
*   **Application Load Balancer (ALB):** Use an ALB to distribute traffic across multiple EC2 instances running the React application. This provides high availability and scalability.
*   **EC2 Instances:** Deploy the React application built code (via CI/CD) to EC2 instances. Use an Auto Scaling Group (ASG) to automatically scale the number of instances based on traffic demand.  Use a Launch Template with an AMI containing the necessary software (Node.js, npm, etc.) and potentially a pre-built Docker image.
*   **Database (RDS):** Since the database type is unknown, I'll assume a managed relational database like PostgreSQL or MySQL on RDS. This simplifies database management and provides high availability. Choose the appropriate database size based on anticipated data volume and traffic.
*   **S3 & CloudFront:**  Use S3 for storing static assets (images, CSS, JavaScript) and CloudFront to deliver these assets with low latency globally. This offloads static content serving from the EC2 instances.
*   **Route53:**  Use Route53 for DNS management and routing traffic to the ALB.
*   **IAM Roles:**  Create IAM roles with least-privilege access for EC2 instances, the ALB, and other AWS services to improve security.
*   **Security Groups:** Use security groups to control inbound and outbound traffic to EC2 instances, the ALB, and the database.  Only allow necessary ports.
*   **Monitoring & Logging (CloudWatch):**  Implement comprehensive monitoring using CloudWatch metrics, logs, and alarms.  Collect application logs, system logs, and ALB access logs.  Use CloudTrail to track API calls for auditing.
*   **SSL/TLS (ACM):**  Use the AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) to provision and manage SSL/TLS certificates for the ALB and CloudFront.
*   **CI/CD Pipeline:**  Implement a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., using AWS CodePipeline, Jenkins, or GitHub Actions) to automate the build, test, and deployment process. The pipeline would build the React application, package it (ideally as a Docker image), and deploy it to the EC2 instances through the ASG.
*   **State Management (Terraform):** Store the Terraform state in an S3 bucket with versioning enabled and use DynamoDB for locking to prevent concurrent modifications.
*   **Infrastructure as Code (Terraform):** Manage the entire infrastructure using Terraform for consistency, repeatability, and version control.
**

## Estimated Monthly Costs

**
*This is a rough estimate. The actual cost can vary significantly depending on usage, instance types, storage requirements, data transfer, and region.*
*   **EC2 (t3.medium x 3):**  $70/month
*   **ALB:** $20/month
*   **RDS (db.t3.medium):** $75/month
*   **S3:** $1/month (depending on storage)
*   **CloudFront:** $5/month (depending on traffic)
*   **Route53:** $0.5/month
*   **CloudWatch:** $5/month (depending on metrics & logs)
*   **CloudTrail:** Free (first copy of events)
*   **VPC & other network charges:** $5/month
*   **Data Transfer:** $10/month (depending on traffic)
**Total Estimated Monthly Cost: ~$191.50**
**

*Note: These cost estimates are approximate and may vary based on usage patterns, region, and AWS pricing changes.*

## Deployment Instructions

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials
   - Terraform installed (v1.0.0+)

2. **Configuration**:
   - Update variables in `terraform.tfvars` to match your requirements
   - Review the Terraform files to ensure they meet your needs

3. **Deployment**:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   terraform plan
   terraform apply
   ```

4. **Cleanup**:
   ```bash
   terraform destroy
   ```

## Notes

- The Terraform files have been generated in the `terraform/` directory
- The configuration is based on the application requirements specified in `inframate.md`
- You may need to customize the Terraform files for your specific needs
